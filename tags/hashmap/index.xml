Introduction By default, Microsoft SQL Server processes strings without considering their case sensitivity. Java, unlike Microsoft SQL Server, is case-sensitive which can result in problems. Specifically, on the project I'm working on, there have been numerous bugs caused by the mismatch in case sensitivity.
Generally, there are many situations where case-insensitive strings are necessary. One such example is with email addresses, which are inherently case-insensitive. Therefore, the issue of case sensitivity is not solely related to the mismatch between MS SQL Server and Java, but rather it is a more widespread concern.</description></item></channel></rss>
